Sudeep: Good morning everyone. Let's start with the Q4 review. We successfully completed 3 major releases and achieved 95% client satisfaction. However, we had some delays in the payment gateway integration.

Priya: Yes, the payment gateway integration took longer than expected. We faced issues with the Razorpay API integration. But we've resolved it now and it's live in production.

Rajesh: From QA perspective, we found 12 critical bugs in the last sprint, all of which have been fixed. Our test coverage is now at 78%, which is good but we should aim for 85% in Q1.

Anjali: I've been working with the client on the new requirements. They want to add multi-currency support and integrate with GST portal. This is a significant enhancement.

Vikram: The infrastructure is stable. We've reduced deployment time from 45 minutes to 15 minutes. However, we need to upgrade our database servers before the next major release.

Sudeep: Great updates. For Q1, our priorities are:
1. Multi-currency support - Priya, can you lead this?
2. GST portal integration - Anjali, you'll coordinate with the client
3. Database upgrade - Vikram, plan this for February
4. Improve test coverage to 85% - Rajesh, this is your target

Priya: Yes, I can lead the multi-currency work. I'll need 2 additional developers for this. Can we get resources allocated?

Sudeep: I'll check with HR and get back to you by Friday.

Discussion:

Sudeep: Welcome everyone. Thank you for choosing ConsultFlow. Let me start by introducing our team. I'm Sudeep, the project lead. SRS here is our technical architect who will be handling the implementation.

SRS: Hello everyone. I'll be working closely with your technical team to ensure smooth integration.

Meera: Great to meet you both. We're very excited about this project. Our main goal is to automate our consulting workflow processes. We handle about 50 client meetings per month and need a solution to streamline the follow-up process.

Arjun: From a technical perspective, we need integration with our existing Microsoft 365 setup. All our emails, calendars, and Teams are on Microsoft. We also have some custom APIs that we might want to integrate later.

Kavya: We have specific requirements for the MOM format. Our clients expect a very structured format with action items clearly highlighted. Also, we need the ability to customize templates.

Sudeep: Perfect. ConsultFlow is built exactly for this use case. We have deep Microsoft 365 integration and our AI MOM generator can be customized. Let me walk you through our standard implementation timeline.

SRS: For the initial setup, we'll need:
1. Azure AD app registration details
2. Access to your Microsoft 365 tenant
3. Sample meeting transcripts to train the MOM format
4. Your preferred email templates

Meera: We can provide all of that. When can we start?

Sudeep: We can begin next week. The setup typically takes 2-3 days, then we'll do a pilot with 5 meetings to fine-tune the MOM format.

Arjun: That sounds good. We'd like weekly status updates every Friday.

Kavya: Also, can we have a demo session next week to see the workflow builder?

SRS: Absolutely. I'll schedule a demo for January 17th at 3 PM IST.

Action Items:
1. Meera to provide Azure AD app registration details by January 13, 2025
2. Arjun to grant Microsoft 365 tenant access by January 14, 2025
3. Kavya to share 10 sample meeting transcripts by January 15, 2025

## Example 3: Sprint Planning Meeting

Sprint 15 Planning Meeting - ConsultFlow Development
Date: January 8, 2025
Time: 9:00 AM - 10:30 AM IST

Attendees:
- Sudeep Ranjan Sahoo (Scrum Master) - sudeep160403@gmail.com
- SRS Dev (Lead Developer) - srsdevka@gmail.com
- Neha Gupta (Frontend Developer) - neha.gupta@company.com
- Rohit Verma (Backend Developer) - rohit.verma@company.com
- Deepak Joshi (QA Engineer) - deepak.joshi@company.com

Location: Office - Conference Room 3

Sprint Goal: Implement scheduled workflow triggers and improve MOM generation accuracy

Discussion:

Sudeep: Good morning team. Welcome to Sprint 15 planning. Our focus this sprint is on scheduled triggers and MOM improvements. Let's review the backlog.

SRS: I've analyzed the scheduled trigger requirements. We need to implement cron-based scheduling. This will require:
1. A job queue system (we can use Bull with Redis)
2. Cron parser for schedule expressions
3. Background worker to execute scheduled workflows

Neha: For the UI, I'll need to create a schedule configuration component. Users should be able to set daily, weekly, or custom schedules.

Rohit: I can handle the backend implementation. We'll need a new collection to store scheduled jobs. I estimate 8 story points for this.

Deepak: I'll need to write tests for the scheduling logic. Also, we should test edge cases like timezone handling.

Sudeep: Good. Now for MOM improvements, what are the issues we're addressing?

SRS: Users reported that action items are sometimes missed. We need to improve the prompt to be more explicit about extracting all action items, even if they're mentioned casually.

Neha: I can work on the MOM preview improvements. Users want to see a formatted preview before generating.

Rohit: I'll update the MOM generator service to use the improved prompt. This should be straightforward.

Deepak: I'll create test cases with various transcript formats to ensure the improvements work.

Sudeep: Let's assign story points:
- Scheduled triggers backend: 8 points (Rohit)
- Scheduled triggers UI: 5 points (Neha)
- MOM prompt improvements: 3 points (Rohit)
- MOM preview enhancements: 3 points (Neha)
- Testing: 5 points (Deepak)
Total: 24 points

SRS: That's reasonable. I'll help with code reviews and architecture decisions.

Action Items:
1. Rohit to implement scheduled trigger backend by January 15, 2025
2. Neha to complete schedule configuration UI by January 14, 2025
3. Rohit to update MOM generator prompt by January 12, 2025
4. Neha to implement MOM preview enhancements by January 13, 2025
5. Deepak to complete test cases by January 16, 2025
6. SRS to review architecture and provide feedback by January 11, 2025
7. Sudeep to update product backlog and create Jira tickets by January 9, 2025

Discussion:

Sudeep: Good morning Dr. Khanna and Dr. Iyer. Thank you for joining. Let me share this month's usage statistics. You've processed 47 meetings through ConsultFlow, generating 47 MOMs and sending 89 automated emails.

Dr. Khanna: That's excellent. The time savings have been significant. Our team is very happy with the tool.

Dr. Iyer: Yes, the MOM quality is very good. However, we have a few feature requests. Can we add support for multiple languages? We have some international clients who prefer MOMs in their local language.

SRS: That's a great suggestion. We can integrate translation services. This would be a premium feature. Let me check the feasibility and get back to you.

Dr. Khanna: Also, we'd like to be able to export MOMs directly to PDF format. Currently, we're copying and converting manually.

Sudeep: PDF export is already on our roadmap for Q1. We can prioritize it if needed.

Dr. Iyer: That would be helpful. One more thing - can we set up custom email templates? We want to brand our emails with our company logo and colors.

SRS: Yes, we're working on template customization. This should be available in the next release, scheduled for February.

Dr. Khanna: Perfect. What about the performance? Any issues?

Sudeep: The system has been running smoothly. Average MOM generation time is 12 seconds, which is well within our SLA. We had 99.8% uptime this month.

Dr. Iyer: That's great. We're planning to scale up usage next month. We might process 80-100 meetings. Will the system handle that?

SRS: Absolutely. Our infrastructure can handle 10x that load. We'll monitor closely during the scale-up.

Action Items:
1. SRS to evaluate multi-language support feasibility by January 12, 2025
